          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p class="intro">With 17 years of experience in IT, Business Development and Management I can say that I am a self-motivated, problem solver individual with the ability to work independently or be a great team leader.
            As project manager I am a detail-oriented individual with good verbal and written communication skills. I also have good computer skills, experienced in online trading and project management. Well organized, with exceptional attention to detail, I’m able to explain, advice and consult with internal teams on any subject in order to choose the best solution, and together achieve the best possible results while consuming as few resources as possible. Possessing extensive experience of supporting, developing and motivating teams and individuals to do better and to drive continuous improvements across a wide range of work activities, I also have a record of accomplishments in coming up with practical improvement initiatives, which grows the company’s overall effectiveness.
